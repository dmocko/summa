2) make_monthly_forcing.pro
   construct serially-complete monthly forcing data

3) stn_exposure.pro
   computes the exposure of all stations

4) plot_stn2grid_monthly.pro
   makes monthly maps of climate variables


2) stn2grid_tollgateMeta.pro
   defines the grid for the interpolation

3) stn2grid_tollgateData.pro
