This directory holds routines to prepare, run, and evaluate
 plumber experiments for SUMMA

+++
PREPARE INPUT FILES...
**********************

 1) processPlumberInputData.pro
    IDL script to read the site netCDF files and output
     a) input data files for each site
     b) attribute files for each site

 2) makeForcingFileInfo.sh
    script to define forcing data files, creating
     a) list of forcing info files used for each site
     b) information on the forcing data file for each site

 3) makeFileManager.sh
    script to make the manager files; separate file for each site
 
 4) makeDecisionsFiles.sh
    script to make the model decisions files
    A separate decisions file is needed for each site, because the time
    period of the simulation is a decision (which differs for each site)

 5) modifySiteVars.sh
    script to read some of the needed site variables from one of the
    participating PLUMBER models (CABLE in this case) and include the
    site variables in a paramTrial file, separate trial file for each
    site

 6) makeNewTables.pro
    IDL script to make site-specific vegetation tables  

+++
PREPARE FILES FOR MODEL SPINUP...
*********************************

 7) makeFileManagerSpinup.sh
    script to make the manager files for model spin-up (one file for each site)
     -- these files point to decisions files with just one year

 8) makeDecisionsSpinup.sh
    script to make the decisions file for spin up (decision = 1-year simulation)

 9) spinupPlumberSites.sh
    loops through PLUMBER sites and calls the spinup script spinupPlumber.sh

10) spinupPlumber.sh
    spinds up for a given SUMMA site (called by spinupPlumberSites.sh)

+++
RUN THE MODEL...
****************

11) runPlumberSites.sh
    script to run SUMMA for all PLUMBER sites

+++
POST-PROCESS...
***************

12) summa2plumber.sh
    script to convert the SUMMA output to the PLUMBER format
    uses two nco scripts
     a) extractGroundHeatFlux1.nco
     b) extractGroundHeatFlux2.nco
    which use different methods to extract the heat flux at the top of the soil column
    and convert to a scale groundHeatFlux variable.

13) compileDecisions.pro
    compiles modeling decisions used in different experiments

14) fixPlumber.sh
    computes net radiatiion which was missing from original plumber models (sum of components)
